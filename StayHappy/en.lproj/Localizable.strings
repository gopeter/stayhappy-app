Today the delicious homemade lasagna, tomorrow the new episode of your favorite series, and the day after tomorrow a hot bath when the children are sleeping. If you don't have anything planned, you'll be presented with beautiful moments from the past or a few points from your personal resource list.";

A special hand cream in the morning, the scent of your favorite perfume, the arranged phone call with your best friend. And with the view of the beautiful little things that will encounter you in the next few days, the flashlight will illuminate more and more corners that may have been hidden by the darkness of thoughts.";
